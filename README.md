# Zormeister's XNU

Various branches for development of my own custom XNU builds, including but not limited to:
- Fixed ARM builds (T7000, BCM2837, etc)
- AMD CPU handling in the x86-64 kernels
- Various changes in available feature flags (eg: commpage in 6153 has the 'kHasSHA' bit, for the opensource corecrypto project)

> [!WARNING]
> This branch does not contain any code! Please switch to the branch of your choosing from [BRANCHING.md](BRANCHING.md)
